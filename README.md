Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It's used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.

Regression is a supervised machine learning technique which is used to predict continuous values.

Linear Regreesion is the most simple and popular technique for predicting a continuous variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the outcome and the predictor variables.

The linear regression equation can be written as y = b0 + b*x + e, where:

b0 is the intercept,
b is the regression weight or coefficient associated with the predictor variable x.
e is the residual error
